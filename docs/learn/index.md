# Learn Powerpipe: Dashboards for DevOps!

Powerpipe is an open-source tool from Turbot that enables DevOps teams to: 

- [Visualize cloud infrastructure](/docs/learn/steampipe#visualize-cloud-infrastructure). Use pre-built dashboards — for AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more — to visualize your cloud resources and answer common questions about resource quantity, cost, usage, and relationships.

- [Visualize logs](/docs/learn/tailpipe#visualize-logs). Use pre-built dashboards for many different kinds of logs to explore and visualize those logs and answer common questions about attack and error patterns, system performance, and user behavior.

- [Run security and compliance benchmarks](/docs/learn/steampipe#run-security-and-compliance-benchmarks). Use pre-built benchmarks to assess how well your clouds comply with the standard frameworks including CIS, GDPR, NIST, PCI, SOC 2, and more.

- [Run log analysis benchmarks](/docs/learn/tailpipe#run-log-analysis-benchmarks). Use pre-built benchmarks to evaluate your logs against the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

- Create your own dashboards and benchmarks. Build from scratch, for [cloud infrastructure](/docs/learn/steampipe#create-your-own-dashboards-and-benchmarks) or [logs](/docs/learn/tailpipe#create-your-own-dashboards-and-benchmarks), using HCL in a live coding environment, or compose with the prebuilt dashboards and benchmarks.
