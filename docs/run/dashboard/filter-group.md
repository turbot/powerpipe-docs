# Filter & Group

When a dashboard displays compliance benchmarks, the **Filter & Group** button enables you to adjust the hierarchy of benchmarks and controls. The default hierarchy is **Benchmark / Control / Result**, but here the **Group** control is used to flatten the view to results only.

You can further restrict the view by setting the **Filter** to only results where the **Status** is **Alarm**.
