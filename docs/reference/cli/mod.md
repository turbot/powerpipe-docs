----
## powerpipe mod init
Initialize the current directory with a `mod.pp` file.

### Examples

Initialize a mod (create a `mod.pp`) in the current directory:

```bash
powerpipe mod init
```

Initialize a mod (create a `mod.pp`) in another directory:

```bash
powerpipe mod init --mod-location ~/my_mod
```

---

## powerpipe mod install
Install one or more mods and their dependencies.

### Arguments
| Flag | Description
|-|-
| `--dry-run` | Show which mods would be installed/updated/uninstalled without modifying them (default `false`).
| `--force` | Install mods even if plugin/cli version requirements are not met (cannot be used with `--dry-run`).

### Git URLs & Private Repos

Powerpipe uses `git` to install and update mods. When you run `powerpipe mod install` or `powerpipe mod update`, Powerpipe will first try using HTTPS and if that does not work it will try SSH.  If your SSH keys are configured properly for `git`, you should be able to pull from private repos that you have access to, as well as public ones.  


### Examples

Install the latest version of a mod and add the `require` statement to your `mod.pp`:
```bash
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights
```

Install an exact version of a mod and update the `require` statement to your `mod.pp`.  This may upgrade or downgrade the mod if it is already installed:
```bash
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights@0.1.0
```

Install a version of a mod using a semver constraint and update the `require` statement to your `mod.pp`.  This may upgrade or downgrade the mod if it is already installed:
```bash
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights@'^1'
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights@1
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights@1.x.x
powerpipe mod install github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-insights@'>=0.20'
```

Install all mods specified in the `mod.pp` and their dependencies:
```bash
powerpipe mod install
```

Preview what `powerpipe mod install` will do, without actually installing anything:
```bash
powerpipe mod install --dry-run
```

---

## powerpipe mod list
List mods from the current mod and its direct dependents.

### Examples


List mods:
```bash
powerpipe mod list
```

List all mods in `JSON` format:
```bash
powerpipe mod list --output json
```

List mods using settings from a workspace:
```bash
powerpipe mod list --workspace my_workspace
```


---

## powerpipe mod show
