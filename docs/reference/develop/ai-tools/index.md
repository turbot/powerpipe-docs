# AI Tools

To help with developing new dashboards, benchmarks, controls, and detections, we've created several prompts to help speed up the process by providing helpful guidelines and examples.

We recommend using multiple prompts to break down each step of the process allowing for additional relevant context to be passed at each stage.

You can use each prompt below in one of several ways:
- Use the prompt directly
- Include the file in your prompt with [Cursor @Files](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files)
- Add it to rules, like [Cursor rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) or [Windsurf rules](https://docs.windsurf.com/plugins/cascade/memories#rules)

We also recommend installing the [Powerpipe MCP Server](https://github.com/turbot/powerpipe-mcp) to help test running dashboards, benchmarks, and queries.
