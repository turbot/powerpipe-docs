# Powerpipe Mods


A Powerpipe **mod** is a portable, versioned collection of related Powerpipe resources such as dashboards, benchmarks, queries, controls, and detections. Powerpipe mods and mod resources are defined in HCL, and distributed as simple text files.  Modules can be found on the [Powerpipe Hub](https://hub.powerpipe.io) and may be shared with others from any public git repository. 

Mods provide an easy way to share dashboards, benchmarks, and other resources.

As you've seen, you can download and install mods from the [Powerpipe Hub](https://hub.powerpipe.io) and use them as-is; [view the dashboards](/docs/run/dashboard), [run benchmarks](/docs/run/benchmark), and [take snapshots](/docs/run/snapshots/) without writing code.

But Powerpipe also makes it simple to [create your own mod](/docs/build/create-mod), [write controls and benchmarks](/docs/build/writing-controls), and [build dashboards](/docs/build/writing-dashboards) to analyze your data and share insights with others!
